PROJECT

- Lays out multiple lists
  |
  -- each list can have as many todos as you want

- Ex: New Todo: Lunch Groceries
                |
                -- Bread
                -- Lettuce
                -- Tomatoes

############################ WHAT IS STATE? #############################

- State: is data that persists over time
- HTTP: known as state-less
        When server finishes handling one response, it forgets everything about that request
        before accepting the next one.

- Servers can remember things between requests -> requires techniques built on top of HTTP

- HTTP has no concept of state itself, but we can use it to send info back and forth that,
  when interpreted correctly on both sides, creates a system where we can persists state
  across requests.

############################ CLEARING COOKIES #############################
- After updating parts of our todo.rb code, we wanted to look at how to clear cookies
  since we were now tracking our users inputs.

- Right click in browser -> Inspect
- Go to 'Application' -> left side list will show Cookies Tab.
- Click on Cookies -> sub-element shows our localhost:4567
                      within this, we can see name: rack.session and value
                      is what is holding our session data. Changing this or deleting it
                      would remove the todo list data in our session.
- Can delete cookie -> simply double click 'value' and clear the input.

To prove the point that the cookie stores our session, lets re-create some todos
  and then edit our cookie.

1. Installed Chrome extension: editthiscookie
 - Little icon of a cookie pops up right of the url search bar.
2. Re-created some todo lists: Test List and Second List
3. Hit our cookie icon, changed a character, saved it, and refreshed page.
4. Our two todo lists were removed.
5. If you copied the original cookie, restarted with a new list, and then repasted
   back in the original cookie, you would go back to the old list of lists!
   WHY? Because all data is stored in that cookie

Session hijacking -> known as copying cookies, and using that data to impersonate people across
                     various websites.
HTTPS -> can be used to secure that

Value of cookies is same data being held on server!
